# Inference Function (predict.py):
* Purpose: Provides an inference function for making predictions using a trained machine learning model.
* Steps:
  * Load configuration settings from YAML files.
  * Load the test dataset.
  * Load a pre-trained machine learning model.
  * Retrieve an example batch from the test dataset.
  * Make predictions using the loaded model.
  * Print relevant debugging information.
* How to Use:
  * Install necessary dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, NumPy).
  * Place your trained model file in the specified path.
  * Update configuration settings in the YAML files.
  * Execute the script by running the main() function.

# Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation (train.py):
* Purpose: Focuses on training and evaluating a machine learning model using PyTorch.
Components:
  * Initialization: Initialize the neural network model, optimizer, and loss criterion.
  * Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess training, validation, and test data using a custom dataset.
  * Training Loop: Train the model for one epoch, updating weights based on gradients.
  * Validation Loop: Evaluate the model on the validation dataset for one epoch.
  * Logging: Provides a class for logging training and validation losses during model training.
* How to Use:
  * Install necessary dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, NumPy).
  * Update configuration parameters in the config_train.yaml file.
  * Execute the script by running the main() function.

# Module for Computing Key Performance Indicators (kpi.py):
* main() Function:
  * Load the test dataset from the specified configuration file.
  * Load a trained machine learning model using the provided model path.
  * Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test data.
  * Plot the ground truth vs. prediction for visualization.
* Metrics Computed:
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * R-squared (coefficient of determination)
* How to Use:
  * Install necessary dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, NumPy).
  * Place your trained model file in the specified path.
  * Update configuration settings in the YAML files.
  * Execute the script by running the main() function.
